This repository includes my Python programs Hello_World.py and Numbers.py. To run them through the terminal, simply input these lines 

python3 Hello_world.py 
python3 Numbers.py

The Hello_world.py program just prints "Hello world" to the terminal.
The Numbers.py program takes in a series of numbers from a text file and reads them. Then it adds all the integers and divides it
by the total number of integers from the file to calculate the average of the series of numbers.
